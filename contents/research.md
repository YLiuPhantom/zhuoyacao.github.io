#### <strong>Migration of High-eccentricity Gas Giants on a Protoplanetary Disk</strong>

Adviser: Prof. Shude Mao & Prof. Douglas N.C. Lin 

Conducting hydrodynamic simulations on gas giant migration on a protoplanetary disk by Athena++. Integrating migration laws from hydro simulations into REBOUNDx framework for effective dynamic simulation on complex planetary systems.



#### <strong>Launching Mechanism for FFPs from Host Stars with Cometary Companions and Close-in Planets</strong>

Adviser: Prof. Douglas N.C. Lin (University of California, Santa Cruz & Westlake University)

Conducted REBOUNDx simulation to test the influence of tides on the production of FFPs from the host stars with cometary companions and close-in planets. Deduced a theoretical model to explain the tide influence on such systems.



#### <strong>Planet Migration on a Protoplanetary Disk with Ring-shaped Dead Zone</strong>

Adviser: Prof. Douglas N.C. Lin

Conducted simulations on migration of planets on a protoplanetary disk with ring shaped dead zone by Athena++. Reveal xxx as a possible mechanism to stop gas giant migration.





#### <strong>Comet Shower at the Pliocene-Pleistocene Transition Triggered by a Stellar Fly-by</strong>

Adviser: Prof. Abraham (Avi) Loeb (Harvard University)

Conducted numerous simulations on Oort cloud and stellar flyby by REBOUND package, revealed and explained the Oort cloud behaviors during single and binary star invasions. Theoretically explained a possible comet shower caused by HD 7977â€™s flyby 3 Myr ago, analyzed comet duration, intensity, and its impact on the ancient Earth. Collected geographic evidence of craters and comet components, revealing that this comet shower could be the cause of the Pliocene-Pleistocene Transition.
