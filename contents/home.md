Welcome to Zhuoya Cao's academic homepage!

I am currently a research assistant in the Division of Astronomy at Westlake University, China. Prior to this, I obtained my B.Sc. from Tsinghua University, China, majoring in Mechanics and minoring in Astronomy.

My research interest lies in dynamics of planetary systems, including rich interactions between a planet and other planets, stellar flybys, and protoplanetary disks. I am currently working with Prof. Shude Mao and Prof. Douglas N.C. Lin on simulations of planetary systems.
